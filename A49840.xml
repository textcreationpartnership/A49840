            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN ſerious Meditation, and weighty Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon thoſe words of Chriſt to <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> John 3.3. <hi>Except a man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God:</hi> And hereby it doth plainly appear that there is an abſolute neceſſity of a ſecond <hi>Birth,</hi> and Work of <hi>Regeneration:</hi> And ſeeing it is thus, it greatly concerns all, that none neglect nor ſlight the day of their <hi>Viſitation,</hi> leſt it be ſaid unto them, as it was ſaid unto <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; How often would I have gathered thee, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickins under her wings, and ye would not,</hi> Matth. 23.37. Here was the Love of God in Jeſus Chriſt unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37447:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 31 -->neglected, or rather rejected the day of their <hi>Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which ſhows, that God is not the Author of mans Deſtruction, as ſome would make him, who hold that Point or Principle of Reprobation; but that man hath Deſtroyed himſelf, according to the Prophets Words <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9 <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> And this I really do believe, that God bath given to all People upon the Face of the Earth a day and time of Viſitation, as he did unto <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> And ſeeing it is thus, what manner of perſons ought we to be in all holy and godly Converſation? The firſt Birth being of the Earth earthly; and as the Apoſtle ſaith, ſpeaking of themſelves as well as others, <hi>Among whom alſo we all had our Converſation in times paſt, in the Luſts of the Fleſh, and were by nature the Children of Wrath, even as others,</hi> Eph. 2.3. Which is a ſtate of Death, and Darkneſs, and Diſobedience, Loving and Delighting in the Creature more then in God the Creator, having the Heart and Mind alina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſeperated from a Life in God and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and their cheif Delight and Pleaſure in things below the Lord, and of this VVorld, and their Minds moſtly exerciſed thereupon, with great Delight and Pleaſure, being not ſubject to the Lord that made them, nor willing to be led and guided by his good Spirit, but chuſing and joyning with that which doth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37447:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 31 -->moſt agree with their carnal ſenſual Minds; neither knowing a Bridle to their Tongue; though they may make a great profeſſion of God, and Chriſt, and Scriptures, and yet their Religion but vain; as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man among you ſeem to be Religious, and bridleth not his Tongue, that mans Religion is vain,</hi> James 1.26. And if this be ſo as I certainly believe it is, then how many mens Religions will prove but vain? who love and delight ſo much in fooliſh Talking and Jeſting, which are not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. And let Experience ſpake to this, whether it be not much the Practice both of Prieſts and People, when they are together; and what Benefit do any of you find by Reading and Speaking of the Scriptures, while you do not Live and Walk accordingly? This doth diſcover your Hypocriſie, and will be a witneſs againſt you: Be not deceived, God will not be mocked, for whatſoever a man ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſhall he alſo Reap, as the Apoſtle is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. <hi>He that ſoweth to the Fleſh, ſhall of the Fleſh reap Corruption; and he that ſoweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap Life Everlaſting.</hi> (Now Mark) here is a ſowing to the Fleſh and to the Spirit, and a reaping accordingly; neither are ſuch willing to take up the daily Croſs, without which none can be his Diſciple, take his own Words for it, <hi>If any man
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37447:3"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 32 -->will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſs daily, and follow me,</hi> Luke 9.23. Nor yet a true Love to Brethren, which is a great evidence and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of an Eternal and Everlaſting Inheritance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We know we are paſt from Death to Life, becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi> And hovv far are unregenerate People from this, as is manifeſt by their Fruits; what Pride, Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Envying and Deſtroying one an other and that about Carnal, Earthly things; and this in ſhort is the eſtate of too many People upon the Face of the whole Earth, in one degree or other, in the firſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before the work of Regeneration be known or witneſſed.</p>
            <p>But being Changed and Redeemed, by the effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al working and opperation of the holy divine Spirit of God upon the Heart; then a great Work wrought and witneſſed, a new Heart, a new Mind, new Love, new Delight, old things are paſſed away, and all things become new; and then, a loving God with all thy Heart, with all thy Soul, and thy Neighbour as thy ſelf, and a Croſs taken up to all the Worlds Ways, Delights and Pleaſures, Cuſtoms, Fellowſhips and Faſhions, though heretofore never ſo much loved and delighted in; and the Heart, Mind and Spirit exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in, and upon Heavenly and Spiritual things,
